Description: fetch and rebase all locally-tracked remote Git branches
 git-up solves the following 'git pull' problems:
 .
 * It merges upstream changes by default, when it's really more polite to
 rebase over them, unless your collaborators enjoy a commit graph that looks
 like bedhead.
 * It only updates the branch you're currently on, which means git push will
 shout at you for being behind on branches you don't particularly care about
 right now.
